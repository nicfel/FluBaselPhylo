# Clusters
In this Folder, a rough clustering of sequences is perfomed. The clustering is either based on pairwise time differences from the time tree estimate (in the TimeTree folder) or based on average nucleotide difference between sequences. The time tree estimates are based only on the HA segment while the average nucleotide difference is calculated using all segments.
