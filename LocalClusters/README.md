# LocalClusters
First, phylogenetic trees are inferred for each of the rough clusters from the Clusters folder. This is done for either the clustering based on the pairwise time differences (for tha HA only) or based on the nucleotide differences (based on all segments)

Sequences that are then grouped into these intitial clusters are next
